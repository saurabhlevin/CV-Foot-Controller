# CV-Foot-Controller
 An arduino-based controller that outputs a 0-5v control voltage or a vairable resistance via a digital potentiometer. Can be used as a CV input for modular gear, or a controllable resistance that can be plugged into an expression of a guitar pedal. Can be used with anything that accepts a 0-5V signal.
